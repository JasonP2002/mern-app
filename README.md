# Product Store Application

MERN application, following the free code camp tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3BUHwfHf84).

### To Run
Create .env file with a MongoDB connection string saved as `MONGO_URI`, and whichever port you would like the application to run on saved as `PORT`.

Run command `npm run start` in your terminal and the application will be found on 
`http://localhost:PORT`, where `PORT` should be the port you saved in the .env file.
